# Nester Smart-Contract Testing Guide

This document describes the test strategy for the Nester Soroban contract
workspace.

---

## Test types

| Type | Location | Command |
|------|----------|---------|
| Unit tests | `contracts/*/src/` and `contracts/*/src/test.rs` | `make test` |
| Integration tests | `tests/integration/src/integration/mod.rs` | `make integration-test` |
| Mainnet fork tests | `contracts/adapter_{pool,lending}/src/mainnet_fork_test.rs` | `make mainnet-fork-test` |

---

## Running tests

```bash
# All unit tests
make test

# Multi-contract integration tests only
make integration-test

# Everything (unit + integration)
cargo test --lib

# Adapter tests against real, mainnet-fetched Blend/Soroswap WASM
make mainnet-fork-fetch   # once, needs BLEND_POOL_CONTRACT_ID / SOROSWAP_PAIR_CONTRACT_ID
make mainnet-fork-test
```

---

## Mainnet fork tests

`contracts/adapter_pool/src/test.rs` and `contracts/adapter_lending/src/test.rs`
run against `nester_test_utils::mocks::{MockAmmPool, MockLendingProtocol}` —
deliberately simplified stand-ins for Soroswap and Blend. A mock can drift
from the real protocol's behavior without any test noticing, which is a risk
we specifically don't want to discover for the first time against mainnet.

The mainnet fork tests close that gap by loading the **real, currently
deployed** Soroswap pair / Blend pool WASM bytecode into the same in-process
Soroban `Env`, fetched by `scripts/fetch-mainnet-fork.sh` via `stellar
contract fetch`, and exercising it directly.

They're opt-in and skip themselves (no `--ignored` needed) unless
`NESTER_MAINNET_FORK=1` is set, so a plain `cargo test`/`make test` never
needs network access, mainnet contract IDs, or the fetched fixtures:

```bash
export BLEND_POOL_CONTRACT_ID=C...       # a real Blend pool on mainnet
export SOROSWAP_PAIR_CONTRACT_ID=C...    # a real Soroswap pair on mainnet
make mainnet-fork-fetch
make mainnet-fork-test
```

**Current finding:** `adapter_pool`'s fork test deploys the real SoroswapPair
and documents that its single-asset `deposit(from, amount, min_units_out)`
cannot drive the real pair's dual-asset, no-amount `deposit(to)` — see the
comment in `contracts/adapter_pool/src/mainnet_fork_test.rs`. `adapter_lending`'s
fork test is narrower (it only verifies the real Blend pool WASM loads)
because a real pool can't be initialized standalone — it's normally deployed
through Blend's `PoolFactoryContract` wired to a specific oracle, backstop,
and reserve list. Fully exercising either fork — and fixing the adapters to
match — is tracked as a pre-mainnet-launch blocker, not solved by this test
suite alone.

---

## Unit tests

Each contract has its own inline `#[cfg(test)]` block or a companion
`test.rs` module. Unit tests deploy only the contract under test and verify
its behaviour in isolation using Soroban's in-process test environment
(`soroban_sdk::Env::default()`).

### Contracts with unit tests

| Contract | Test file |
|----------|-----------|
| `vault` | `contracts/vault/src/lib.rs` (inline) |
| `vault_token` | `contracts/vault_token/src/test.rs` |
| `yield_registry` | `contracts/yield_registry/src/test.rs` |
| `allocation_strategy` | `contracts/allocation_strategy/src/test.rs` |
| `access_control` | `contracts/access_control/src/test.rs` |

---

## Integration tests

Multi-contract tests live in the `nester-integration-tests` crate
(`tests/integration/`). They use the `NesterHarness` helper from
`libs/test_utils` to deploy all contracts in a single environment with correct
cross-references.

### `NesterHarness`

`NesterHarness::setup()` deploys all five contracts and initialises them in
dependency order:

1. `VaultContract` — AccessControl bootstrapped with a shared admin.
2. `VaultTokenContract` — vault address stored as sole minter/burner.
3. `YieldRegistryContract` — AccessControl bootstrapped with the same admin.
4. `AllocationStrategyContract` — registry address stored so `set_weights` can
   validate sources via cross-contract calls.

Client handles are available via `h.vault()`, `h.token()`, `h.registry()`,
and `h.strategy()`.

### Integration scenarios

| Scenario | Test function | What it validates |
|----------|---------------|-------------------|
| 1 | `all_contracts_initialise_cleanly` | All five contracts deploy and initialise without error |
| 2 | `strategy_set_weights_validates_sources_via_registry` | `set_weights` performs a live cross-contract call to the registry to confirm each source is active |
| 3 | `strategy_rejects_weights_for_unregistered_source` | Cross-contract validation rejects unknown source IDs |
| 4 | `strategy_rejects_weights_for_paused_source` | Cross-contract validation rejects paused (inactive) sources |
| 5 | `calculate_allocation_distributes_total_proportionally` | Allocation math distributes a total correctly across sources after cross-contract weight validation |
| 6 | `calculate_allocation_assigns_remainder_to_highest_weight_source` | Rounding remainder is fully assigned (no funds lost) |
| 7 | `admin_can_grant_operator_who_can_set_weights` | Admin grants Operator role; operator can call `set_weights` |
| 8 | `non_operator_cannot_set_weights` | Unauthorised address is rejected by `set_weights` |
| 9 | `deposit_is_rejected_when_vault_is_paused` | `deposit()` panics when vault is paused |
| 10 | `withdraw_is_rejected_when_vault_is_paused` | `withdraw()` panics when vault is paused |
| 11 | `vault_accepts_deposit_after_unpause` | Unpause restores deposit functionality |
| 12 | `non_admin_cannot_pause_vault` | Non-admin address is rejected by `pause()` |
| 13 | `two_users_receive_proportional_yield_on_withdrawal` | Two users share yield proportionally via VaultToken share math |
| 14 | `late_depositor_does_not_capture_prior_yield` | A user who deposits after yield accrues does not retroactively earn that yield |

---

## Test utilities (`libs/test_utils`)

| Module | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `env` | `setup_test_env()` — creates a default `Env` |
| `assertions` | `assert_error`, `assert_ok`, `assert_eq_balance`, `assert_reentrancy_blocked` helpers |
| `harness` | `NesterHarness` — full-protocol deployment harness for integration tests |
| `hostile` | Reentrant token, strategy, and yield-source mocks for adversarial tests |

---

## Reentrancy guard resource cost

The shared reentrancy guard uses Soroban temporary storage so the lock is scoped to the current transaction and clears automatically on revert.

Measured in-process via `env.budget().reset_tracker()` around guarded `deposit` and `withdraw` calls in `vault` unit tests (`measure_reentrancy_guard_resource_cost_on_deposit_and_withdraw`). Run:

```bash
cargo test -p vault-contract measure_reentrancy_guard_resource_cost -- --nocapture
```

Record the printed CPU instruction and memory byte totals below when validating guard overhead. Native Rust test execution underestimates WASM costs; treat these as relative baselines.

| Operation | CPU instructions | Memory bytes |
|-----------|------------------|--------------|
| `deposit` (with guard) | 2,285,474 | 249,857 |
| `withdraw` (with guard) | 3,153,289 | 357,906 |

---

## Adversarial integration tests

`tests/integration/src/integration/adversarial_tests.rs` exercises hostile mocks from `libs/test_utils/src/hostile.rs`:

| Scenario | What it validates |
|----------|-------------------|
| `reentrant_token_during_deposit_is_blocked` | Token transfer hook cannot re-enter via `withdraw` |
| `reentrant_strategy_during_rebalance_is_blocked` | Strategy callback cannot re-enter during rebalance |
| `reentrant_yield_source_during_harvest_is_blocked` | External fee sink cannot re-enter during harvest |
| `unregistered_callee_is_rejected` | Callee allowlist blocks unknown cross-contract targets |
| `nested_emergency_queue_processing_does_not_double_guard` | Legitimate internal nesting via unguarded variants |

---

## Adding new integration scenarios

1. Open `tests/integration/src/integration/mod.rs`.
2. Add a `#[test]` function that calls `NesterHarness::setup()`.
3. Use `h.vault()`, `h.token()`, `h.registry()`, `h.strategy()` to interact
   with contracts.
4. Run `make integration-test` to verify.

---

## Property-based invariant tests

`tests/integration/src/integration/property_tests.rs` contains property-based
tests that validate core vault accounting invariants across thousands of
randomised operation sequences.

### Invariants tested

| Invariant | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Share balance consistency | Sum of all user shares equals total_shares |
| Share price monotonicity | Share price never decreases with positive yield |
| Round-trip safety | Deposit then withdraw never returns more than deposited |
| First deposit 1:1 | First deposit into empty vault creates 1:1 shares |
| Conservation | Total assets equals sum of withdrawable + accrued fees |

### Reference model

A `ReferenceModel` provides an obviously-correct implementation of vault
accounting. Randomised operations are applied to both the real contract and
the reference model, and invariants are asserted after each step.

### Running property tests

```bash
# Default (100 cases)
cargo test -p nester-integration-tests property_tests

# Deep run (override case count)
PROPTEST_CASES=1000 cargo test -p nester-integration-tests property_tests

# Specific property
cargo test -p nester-integration-tests prop_share_balance_consistency
```

### Reproducing failures

When a property fails, proptest prints the shrunk minimal sequence. The
persistence file is committed so regressions stay caught. Re-run with the
same seed to reproduce deterministically.

### Edge cases covered

Generators exercise adversarial values:
- 1 stroop amounts
- MIN_DEPOSIT boundary (10_000_000)
- Large amounts (100_000+ XLM)
- Empty vault first deposits
- Full supply withdrawals
- Long operation sequences (up to 50 operations)
